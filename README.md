# Hello everybody ðŸ‘‹

My name is Bilal and i am a junior-level web-developer for 2 years now. I work in an e-commerce agency, where we create, update and design Magento 1, Magento 2, OpenMage, Mage-OS, Shopware 5 and Shopware 6 based Online-Shops. We also create extensions and plug-ins, make translations and we add semantic information to elements for great lighthouse results.

## My most-popular repository

Chemperator is my actual most-popular project. This software is based on php and a mariadb database. It will help chemistry companies to organize whole processes in developing, fullfilling and selling cleaning-products.
